## About Me

I'm an Ph.D. student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Cas Cremers](https://people.cispa.io/cas.cremers/). 
The main focus of my research is the theory and practice of automated reasoning, aimed at developing techniques that assist us in solving computationally hard problems such as the verification of security protocols, software, and hardware. 
Together with [Aurora Naska](https://cispa.de/en/people/aurora.naska) and Cas Cremers I have created and analyzed an extensive formal model of [DMTF's SPDM](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/spdm) protocol to enable infrastrucuture security. 
With [Robert K端nnemann](http://www.kunnemann.de/) I have proposed novel techniques to verify rule-based risk assessment techniques using methods from the Symbolic Model of Cryptography. 

Before starting my Ph.D. journey, 
I did a Master (MSc) in *Computer Science* under [Prof. Michael Backes](https://cispa.de/en/people/backes) and Robert K端nnemann at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), Germany, Saarbr端cken. 
There I also finished my Bachelor (BSc) in *Cybersecurity* under Prof. Michael Backes and Robert K端nnemann.

## Research Interests

- **Formal Analysis of Protocols**
