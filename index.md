## About Me

I'm a Ph.D. student at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Cas Cremers](https://people.cispa.io/cas.cremers/).
The main focus of my research is the theory and practice of automated reasoning, aimed at developing techniques that assist us in solving computationally hard problems such as the verification of security protocols, software, and hardware.
Together with [Aurora Naska](https://cispa.de/en/people/aurora.naska) and Cas Cremers I have created and analyzed an extensive formal model of [DMTF's SPDM](https://www.dmtf.org/standards/spdm) protocol to enable infrastrucuture security.
With [Niklas Medinger](https://niklasmedinger.github.io/) and Cas Cremers I have proposed novel security notions for key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) while also introducing a methodology to analyse protocols relying on
KEMs in the symbolic model of cryptography.

Before starting my Ph.D. journey,
I did a Master (MSc) in _Computer Science_ under Prof. Dr. Cas Cremers and Dr. Robert Künnemann at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), Germany, Saarbrücken.
There I also finished my Bachelor (BSc) in _Cybersecurity_ under [Prof. Michael Backes](https://michaelbackes.eu/) and [Dr. Robert Künnemann](http://kunnemann.de/).

## Research Interests

- **Formal Analysis of Protocols**
